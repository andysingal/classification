We have a new, secondary JIRA instance that we'd like to add as a content source in SearchUnify. I thought I could add it myself, but I've run into a roadblock. The new JIRA instance is all one single project, and we want to target indexing only issues with the Issue Type of \"GTSE\" or \"Feature Request\" (I believe the field to target for that is \"issuetype\"). Is it possible to do that? I've been looking at the \"By Content Type\" tab in the content source management page and can't figure out how to do it. By the way, the new JIRA instance is added to our content sources already and is called \"Jira 401\". We are in the process of creating a Jira app so we can authenticate with OAuth, but have not completed that process yet.</th>\n",

      "Hi Team, I wanted to reach out with some feedback I’ve received from the Team on SearchUnify and possible Salesforce issues as well as suggestions for improvement. Search Bar Keywords: When searching in Lightning, the search bar does not save the words you searched for. This makes agents have to re-type their search terms each time they click on an article that is not what they were looking for. It would be nice for the search bar to retain the keywords that were last searched. Case Comment Issue: Another agent noticed an issue when trying to save comments to a case. When adding comments and hitting “Save”, the screen would seem as if it was loading or thinking. The agent noticed that KA’s were showing up, but SearchUnify was not. It seemed that once SearchUnify finished updating the page, the comment would then appear. It seems that the comments do not refresh until SearchUnify does. Prior to SearchUnify, agents did not have to refresh the page in order to save comments. Also, agents have reported intermittent slowness and lag that seems to coincide with the time that SearchUnify has been implemented. Are we able to look into this, to determine if it is truly a SearchUnify, or Salesforce issue? Please reach out with any questions at all. Thank You Question\n",

Search Bar Keywords: When searching in Lightning, the search bar does not save the words you searched for. This makes agents have to re-type their search terms each time they click on an article that is not what they were looking for. It would be nice for the search bar to retain the keywords that were last searched. Case Comment Issue: Another agent noticed an issue when trying to save comments to a case. When adding comments and hitting “Save”, the screen would seem as if it was loading or thinking. The agent noticed that KA’s were showing up, but SearchUnify was not. It seemed that once SearchUnify finished updating the page, the comment would then appear. It seems that the comments do not refresh until SearchUnify does. Prior to SearchUnify, agents did not have to refresh the page in order to save comments. Also, agents have reported intermittent slowness and lag that seems to coincide with the time that SearchUnify has been implemented. Are we able to look into this, to determine if it is truly a SearchUnify, or Salesforce issue? Please reach out with any questions at all. Thank You',\n",
